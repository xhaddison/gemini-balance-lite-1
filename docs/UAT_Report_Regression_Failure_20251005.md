# UAT Report: 502 Bad Gateway Fix Verification - CRITICAL REGRESSION

- **Test ID:** UAT-20251005-502-Fix-2
- **Feature:** Graceful handling of upstream API errors.
- **Test Objective:** Verify that when an unauthenticated request is sent, the service immediately returns the upstream API's `401 Unauthorized` error instead of a `502 Bad Gateway`.
- **Preview URL:** `https://gemini-balance-lite-95xs55qk0-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app`
- **Test Date:** 2025-10-05

### Conclusion: FAILED

The test has failed catastrophically. The fix has introduced a severe regression.

- **Expected Result:** HTTP Status `401 Unauthorized`.
- **Actual Result:** HTTP Status `404 Not Found`.

The service endpoint `/v1/` is now completely unreachable, returning a `404` error directly from the Vercel edge network. This indicates a fundamental failure in the deployment's routing configuration. The request is not reaching the application logic at all.

This build is rejected. The issue must be escalated to the `developer` with highest priority to investigate the Vercel routing configuration (`vercel.json`) and the application's entry point.
