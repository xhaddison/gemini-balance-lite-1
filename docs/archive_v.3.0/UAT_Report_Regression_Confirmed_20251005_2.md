# UAT Report: Critical Regression Confirmed (Instance 2)

**Report ID:** UAT-20251005-REGRESSION-CONFIRMED-2
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Preview URL:** `https://gemini-balance-lite-5hiijo1iv-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app`
**Status:** **FAILED**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This User Acceptance Test (UAT) was conducted to verify the final fix for all known routing and error handling bugs. The results indicate a **catastrophic failure** and a **critical regression** in the deployed preview. All core functionalities of the service are currently non-operational. The deployment is definitively **not approved** for production release.

This report documents a failure instance identical in nature to the one recorded in `UAT_Report_Regression_Confirmed_20251005.md`, but for a different preview deployment.

## 2. Test Cases and Results

| Test Case ID | Description                                     | Expected Result        | Actual Result            | Status  |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------- | :------ |
| UAT-TC-01    | **Invalid JSON Handling** at `/api/balance`       | `400 Bad Request`      | `404 Not Found`          | **FAIL**|
| UAT-TC-02    | **Upstream Error Handling** at `/api/balance`     | Upstream `401/Error`   | `404 Not Found`          | **FAIL**|
| UAT-TC-03    | **Admin Endpoint Functionality** at `/api/keys` | `200 OK` with auth     | `401 Unauthorized` (even with valid key) | **FAIL**|

## 3. Analysis of Failure

The test results point to two fundamental, high-severity issues:

1.  **Routing Failure for Core Endpoint:** The primary endpoint, `/api/balance`, is completely inaccessible (`404 Not Found`). This prevents any and all core balance-checking operations from being performed.
2.  **Authentication Logic Failure:** The administrative endpoint, `/api/keys`, fails to authorize requests even when a valid `ADMIN_LOGIN_KEY` is provided. This renders all administrative functions unusable.

The combination of these failures means the service is in a worse state than before the attempted fix. This is a classic example of a **regression**.

## 4. Recommendation

**Immediate rollback or remediation is required.**

The current build is fundamentally broken and must not proceed to production under any circumstances. The development team needs to be immediately alerted to this critical regression.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Escalate this report to the `developer` agent and the `project-manager`.
2.  The `developer` must investigate the root cause of the routing and authentication failures.
3.  A new preview deployment with a verifiable fix is required before a new UAT cycle can begin.
