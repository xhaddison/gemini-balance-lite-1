# UAT Report: Critical 404 NOT_FOUND Failure

- **Test ID**: UAT-20251005-01
- **Test Target**: `https://gemini-balance-lite-1yeizx1bg-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app/api/v1`
- **Test Focus**: 404 Route Fix, Dynamic Key Management, Regression Checks
- **Test Time**: 2025-10-05
- **Tester**: product-manager

---

## 1. Expected Outcome

The API endpoint should return a `200 OK` status with a valid JSON response from the upstream Gemini API, confirming that the routing, API logic, and dynamic key retrieval are all functioning correctly.

## 2. Actual Outcome

**TEST FAILED**.

The API endpoint returned a `404 NOT_FOUND` error. The core API route is not available on the deployed preview URL.

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
...
The page could not be found
```

## 3. Diagnosis & Root Cause Analysis

A thorough review of the project configuration and Git status has revealed the root cause of this failure.

- **`vercel.json`**: The routing configuration is syntactically correct, with a rewrite rule mapping `/api/v1/(.*)` to the Serverless Function at `/api/v1/chat/completions.js`.
- **Local File System**: The target file, `api/v1/chat/completions.js`, exists in the local repository.
- **Root Cause**: The `git status` output confirms that the entire `api/v1/` directory is **untracked by Git**.

The critical API handler file was never added to the Git repository. Consequently, during the Vercel deployment process, this file was not included in the build. The rewrite rule in `vercel.json` therefore points to a non-existent destination, resulting in a definitive `404` error for all requests.

## 4. Next Steps & Recommendations

This is a critical deployment process failure, not a code logic failure. The fix is straightforward.

- **Action**: The `developer` agent must add the untracked directory to Git version control.
- **Command**: `git add api/v1/`
- **Next Step**: After adding the file, a new deployment must be triggered. The subsequent deployment should correctly include the API route, resolving the 404 error.

The issue will now be handed over to the `developer` agent for immediate resolution.
