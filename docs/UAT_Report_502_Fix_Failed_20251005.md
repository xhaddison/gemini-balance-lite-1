# UAT Report: 502 Bad Gateway Fix Verification

- **Test ID:** UAT-20251005-502-FIX-VERIFICATION
- **Feature:** `handleRequest` 502 Bad Gateway Hotfix
- **Preview URL:** `https://gemini-balance-lite-9ds03zdh3-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app`
- **Overall Result:** ❌ **FAILED**

---

## Summary

The deployment has **failed** to fix the critical `502 Bad Gateway` error.

While the new logic correctly rejects malformed JSON requests, it does not properly handle valid requests that result in an error from the upstream API (Google Gemini). Instead of proxying the upstream error (e.g., 401 Unauthorized), the function crashes and returns a `502 Bad Gateway`. This indicates the core bug was not resolved.

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Malformed JSON Request

- **Description:** Send a POST request with a deliberately broken JSON body.
- **Status:** ✅ **PASSED**
- **Expected Result:** The server should reject the request with a `400 Bad Request` status code.
- **Actual Result:** The server correctly returned a `400 Bad Request` with the message: `{"success":false,"message":"Invalid JSON request body. Please ensure it is well-formed."}`.

### Case 2: Valid Request Leading to Upstream API Error

- **Description:** Send a structurally valid POST request to `/v1/` that is expected to fail at the upstream API (e.g., due to a missing API key).
- **Status:** ❌ **FAILED**
- **Expected Result:** The server should proxy the request and return the error response from the upstream Google Gemini API (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`).
- **Actual Result:** The server returned a `502 Bad Gateway`, indicating that the Vercel function itself crashed while trying to handle the upstream response.

## Recommendation

The fix is incomplete and **must not** be deployed to production. The issue needs to be returned to the `developer` for further investigation. The focus should be on the error handling within the `try-catch` block that wraps the `fetch` call to the upstream API in `src/handle_request.js`.
