# UAT Report: ReferenceError Fix & Enhanced Logging

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Test Environment URL**: `https://gemini-balance-lite-ajwvfpvyv-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app`
**Executor**: product-manager (Claude)

## 1. Executive Summary

The User Acceptance Test (UAT) for the `ReferenceError` bug fix and the addition of enhanced diagnostic logging has **FAILED**.

While the robustness validation for malformed requests passed successfully, the core functionality is critically blocked by a server configuration error. The application is unable to access the `GEMINI_API_KEY`, resulting in a `500 Internal Server Error` for all valid requests. This is a blocking issue that prevents the application from fulfilling its primary function.

**Overall Status**: **FAILED / BLOCKED**

## 2. Test Cases and Results

### TC1: Health Check (Core Functionality)

-   **Objective**: Verify that a correctly formatted request to the `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint returns a successful response.
-   **Action**: Sent a `POST` request with a valid `messages` array.
-   **Expected Result**: `200 OK`
-   **Actual Result**: `500 Internal Server Error`
-   **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {"error":{"message":"Server configuration error: Missing Gemini API Key.","type":"server_error"}}
    ```
-   **Conclusion**: **FAILED**. The core API functionality is non-operational due to a missing API key in the server environment.

### TC2: Robustness Validation (Invalid Input)

-   **Objective**: Verify that a malformed request (missing the `messages` field) is handled gracefully and returns a client-side error.
-   **Action**: Sent a `POST` request with a JSON body lacking the `messages` field.
-   **Expected Result**: `400 Bad Request` with a descriptive error message.
-   **Actual Result**: `400 Bad Request`
-   **Response Body**:
    ```json
    {"error":{"message":"Invalid request body: 'messages' must be an array.","type":"invalid_request_error"}}
    ```
-   **Conclusion**: **PASSED**. The application's input validation and error handling for malformed requests are working as expected.

## 3. Analysis and Next Steps

The UAT has revealed a critical, blocking issue. The successful `ReferenceError` fix is overshadowed by a severe environment configuration problem on Vercel.

**Root Cause**:
The `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is not accessible to the Vercel Edge Runtime, preventing any successful calls to the backend service.

**Recommendation**:
1.  **BLOCKER**: The immediate and highest priority is to resolve the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable issue within the Vercel project settings.
2.  **RE-TEST**: Once the environment variable is confirmed to be correctly configured, a full UAT cycle must be re-executed to validate the fix.
3.  **DO NOT DEPLOY**: The application is not in a deployable state.

This report will be archived in the `/docs` directory as the single source of truth for this UAT cycle.
