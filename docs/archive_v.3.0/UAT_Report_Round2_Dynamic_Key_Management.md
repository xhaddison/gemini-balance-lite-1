- **Status**: **PASSED**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the successful completion of the second round of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the refactored Dynamic Key Management feature. All core functionalities, including authentication, displaying, adding, and deleting API keys via the `/public/admin.html` interface, have been verified and are working as expected.

The critical issue of "batch overwriting" identified in the first UAT round has been fully resolved. The system now correctly handles atomic, individual key operations, ensuring data integrity and stability.

## 2. Test Environment

-   **Application URL**: `/public/admin.html` (Local Test Environment)
-   **Backend API Endpoint**: `/api/keys`
-   **Authentication**: Environment Variable `ADMIN_LOGIN_KEY`

Click "Login".                                           | The login section is hidden, and the key management section appears, displaying the current list of keys. | The management section appeared, and the initial key list was fetched and displayed correctly.            | **PASS**    |

An empty list was shown correctly.        | **PASS**    |

Click "Add Key".                                                       | The new key appears in the list on the UI. A success message is shown. The key is added to the Vercel KV.   | The UI updated immediately, a success message was shown, and the key was verified in the backend.         | **PASS**    |

No API call was made.  | **PASS**    |
| **UAT-DM-006** | **Delete a Single Key - Confirm**                                         | 1. Log in. <br> 2. Click the "Delete" button for an existing key. <br> 3. A confirmation dialog appears. <br> 4. Click "OK".                  | The key is removed from the UI list. A success message is shown. The key is removed from the Vercel KV.   | The UI updated correctly after confirming the dialog, and the key was verified as deleted in the backend. | **PASS**    |
| **UAT-DM-007** | **Delete a Single Key - Cancel**                                          | 1. Log in. <br> 2. Click the "Delete" button. <br> 3. A confirmation dialog appears. <br> 4. Click "Cancel".                                   | The key remains in the UI list, and no change occurs in the backend.                                      | The operation was aborted as expected. The key list remained unchanged.                                   | **PASS**    |
| **UAT-DM-008** | **Data Consistency**                                                      | 1. Perform multiple add and delete operations in succession. <br> 2. Refresh the page and log in again after each operation.                      | The UI always reflects the true state of the keys in the Vercel KV.                                       | Data consistency was maintained across all operations. The UI and backend were in perfect sync.           | **PASS**    |

## 4. Regression Verification

The critical risks identified in the first UAT report (`UAT_Report_Dynamic_Key_Management_Failure_2025-09-27.md`) have been fully addressed:

-   **Risk of Batch Overwrite**: **Mitigated**. The new API uses atomic `addKey` and `deleteKey` operations, completely eliminating the "read-modify-write" pattern that caused the data loss issue.
-   **Lack of Confirmation**: **Mitigated**. A JavaScript `confirm()` dialog has been implemented for all delete operations, preventing accidental data loss.
-   **Poor User Feedback**: **Mitigated**. The interface now provides clear, temporary success and error messages for all user actions.

## 5. Final Conclusion

The refactored Dynamic Key Management feature meets all specified requirements and is approved for release. The development team has successfully addressed the failures of the initial implementation and delivered a robust and reliable solution.

The project can now proceed to the next stage. Please hand this report over to the `project-manager` for project tracking and documentation updates.
