# Urgent: Production Serverless Function Timeout - Suspected Network Egress Issue

## Project Information

- **Project Name**: `gemini-balance-lite`
- **Failing Deployment URL**: `https://gemini-balance-lite-9c9lt290i-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app`

## Problem Description

1.  Our primary Serverless Function, located at `api/v1/chat/completions.js`, is consistently failing in the production environment with a `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT` error.
2.  The core logic of this function involves establishing a connection to our Upstash Redis instance. We suspect that the function is being blocked when attempting to make this outbound connection, causing it to hang until the timeout is reached.
3.  We have attempted to mitigate this by setting the `maxDuration` for the function to 60 seconds in our `vercel.json` configuration. This change did not resolve the issue, which suggests a platform-level hard timeout or a network connectivity problem rather than a simple execution time limit.

## Key Evidence

The evidence strongly points to an issue within the Vercel execution environment:

1.  **Failure in Vercel Environment**: Any `POST` request made to `https://gemini-balance-lite-9c9lt290i-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app/api/v1/chat/completions` reliably reproduces the timeout error. The function logs confirm the invocation starts but never completes the Redis connection.

2.  **Success in External Environment**: We have created an isolated Node.js test script (`redis_test.js`) that uses the exact same credentials and the `@upstash/redis` library. When this script is executed from a local environment, it **successfully** connects to the production Redis instance (`rested-imp-13075.upstash.io`) and receives the expected `PONG` response.

## Conclusion

The discrepancy in behavior between the Vercel environment and our local environment is the critical piece of evidence. Since the code, credentials, and Redis database are identical in both scenarios, the failure is almost certainly isolated to the Vercel Serverless Function's execution context.

We conclude that the issue is not with our application code, credentials, or the Redis database itself. Instead, the evidence strongly suggests a problem with network egress from the Serverless Function, preventing it from accessing the Upstash Redis endpoint at `rested-imp-13075.upstash.io`.

## Our Request

We kindly request that the Vercel technical team investigate the network logs for this specific deployment (`gemini-balance-lite-9c9lt290i-xhaddisons-projects.vercel.app`). Please confirm if there are any outbound network policies or firewall rules that might be blocking egress traffic to the `rested-imp-13075.upstash.io` endpoint.

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.
